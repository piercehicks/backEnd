1.) Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

a. Making coffee;
SEQUENCE for  making coffee
    INPUT water in coffee maker.
    INPUT coffee into coffee maker.
     INIT coffee maker.
  END

b. Washing dishes;
WHILE running water
  INPUT dirty dishes
  INPUT Soap and sponge to scrub
  OUTPUT clean dish from water
 END

c. Survive Traffic
  INPUT favorite podcast
  COMPUTE amount of time you will be in traffic. Make peace with it.
  INIT favorite podcast
  OUTPUT horn sound from car when you get cut coffee
END


2.) As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem.
It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation.
Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g.,
Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example
(such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more
relevant results than other search engines;
what about each of your cases make them stand out?

3 companies
  1. Ford Motor Company: For Ford it would have to be assembly line to
    assemble cars.What makes them stand out is the efficiency of the line with
    specialized workers
  2. Uber: The application utilizes current car owners instead  of its own fleet.
          What makes them stand out is they used vehicles already on the road to 
          transport passengers skipping the overhead cost.
  3. Amazon: Suggestion analyzation algorithm. What makes it special is how
              highly personalized each suggested  or partnering items list is.

  3.) A efficient algorithm to me whatever series of steps accomplishes the goal
      with the best balance of cost, speed and quality of result or output.
