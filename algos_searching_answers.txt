Questions
1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

A real life linear search would be an employee checking a line of cereal on
the shelf for a particular one that a customer said expired.
He'd be going down the line/aisle one by one.

2.What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

          Searching words in a dictionary

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many
iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

7 iterations

Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint,
how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

   3 iterations

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose
between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

If it’s unsorted we have to use linear since it won’t have a middle for binary

6.Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose
 between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

I would choose binary because once sorted I can set a low, high and medium
then start my search from the middle instead of the beginning

1.
You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the
dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.
******

let array = ["soup","gut", "albatross", "car","bike"];

function binarySearch(arr,word){
  let high = arr.length-1;
  let low = 0;
  let mid = 0 ;

   while(low <= high){
  mid = Math.floor((high+low)/2)
   if (arr[mid]== word){
     return arr[mid];
   }else if(word >arr[mid]){
       low = mid + 1;
   }else{
     high = mid - 1;
   }
  }
 return "Not in dictionary";
}

let sortedDictionary = array.sort();
//console.log(sortedDictionary);
console.log(binarySearch( sortedDictionary,  "albatross") );

You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted
goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.
****

function searchingFish(arr,spottedFish){
   for (let i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
     if(arr[i]===spottedFish)
       return "Found, spotted fish";
   }
     return "Not spotted fish! " ;
  }

console.log( searchingFish(['spottedFish','nemo','zebra fish'],'spottedFish'));
