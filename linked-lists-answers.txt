1. What are some pros and cons of using linked lists instead of arrays?
    a. Pros: Save on data expenses by not needing to rearrange the physical
       memory space to make room
    b. Cons: Less efficient to access an element in a list than a array, speed-wise

2. Real-World Example
   a. A real-world example would be file folders on your computer. While not
      necessarily all in a certain order each file folder name informs
      you where a file/element may be.

1. Code issue is that the newer node is being placed next to the existing/head node.
   The goal is...

    "The linked list push function should take a value, create a node,
     and add it to the end of a list"

     what it's doing now is akin to going from [1,2,3] insert 4 to [1,4,2,3]
     instead of [1,2,3,4]

   An example of this process is...

   let arr = [1,2,3];
let returnedArr = arr.push(4);

//console.log(arr);



2. Given an unsorted singly linked list, remove all duplicates from the linked list.
  Answer:

  const arr = ['a', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'a'];

let uniqueArr = [...new Set(arr)];
// console.log(uniqueArr);


3.//Given an unsorted singly linked list, reverse it.
//Example
//Input: a -> b -> c -> d
//Output: d -> c -> b -> a


Answer:
const arr = ["a","b","c","d"];

let reversedArr = arr.reverse();

//console.log(reversedArr);
