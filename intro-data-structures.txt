A.) use array input
let riderLine = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"];
// console.log(riderLine);


B.) Insert a new person, "Mary" at the end of the line.
riderLine.push("Mary");
// console.log(riderLine);


C.) Find a person in line named "Josh." This function should return the position of 2 in the array

let riderLine = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"];
let Rider = "Josh";


let findRider = (Rider) => {
  return riderLine.indexOf(Rider) ;
}

findRider(Rider);


D.) Find a person in line named "Emily."
function findEmily(){
  if (riderLine.indexOf("Emily") , 0) {
      return "She's in line";
      } else {
        return "She's not in line";
      }
};
// console.log(findEmily());

E.) Ava wants to allow a friend, "Melissa", to cut in line in front of her
riderLine.splice(1,0, "Mellisa");
// console.log(riderLine);

F.) Patrick wants to leave the line
riderLine.splice(4,1);
// console.log(riderLine);

2.) Provide another real-world example that you can model using a data structure.
//A good example will be my favorite thing on the internet,Google Drive. A Cloud file management software that is a system of organized/nested folders of files.

3.) How would your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
// I partially answered this previously but if we are referring to Google Drive, it would be the manipulation of files locations and C.R.U.D operations.
