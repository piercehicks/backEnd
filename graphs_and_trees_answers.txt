> What is a binary tree and what makes it unique to other trees?
 Answer: A binary tree is a data structure used by developers to create such
 things as quick searches and compress files. What separates them from other
 trees is that they have child nodes, left and right.

> What is a heuristic?
Answer: In the context of computer science, it's our best guess and isn't guaranteed
 to be the absolute best solution.

> What is another problem besides the shortest-path problem that requires the use of heuristics?
Answer: A problem that requires heuristics would probably be algorithms for games, particularly
 chess.

> What is the difference between a depth-first search and a breadth-first search?
Answer: DFS is a search is one that goes all the way down a branch then moves up, think vertical. A BFS
searches across, think horizontal.

> Explain in your own words what an undirected, a-cyclic, unweighted graph is.
A graph that is usually similar to a Linked List and most trees. More detailed,
it's a Non-looping graph with no set beginning and end.

> What kind of graph is a binary search tree?
I'm going with unweighted since most Tree graphs fit this category.

1. Given a Binary Search Tree and a value, write a function that checks to see whether the value exists within the tree.



2. Given a Binary Search Tree and two nodes, n1 and n2, write a function that finds the distance between the two nodes.
