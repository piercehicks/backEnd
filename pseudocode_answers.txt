Why do programmers use pseudocode?
> Programmers use psuedocode to develop algorithms. It is a way to express code without a language that way any type of developer can interpret it.

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
> Nothing. It is not a programming language.

Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

 INPUT number A
INPUT number B
IF  number A greater than B THEN
PRINT “Number A”
ELSE IF number B great than A THEN
PRINT “Number B”


2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

FOR each count of 1 PRINT the number

ENDFOR when number is less than or equal to 100



3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

FOR each entry in phonebook
 	Iterate through list for matching value
	IF entry matches value
		RETURN the entry
ENDFOR PRINT matching entry with name and number


4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

In Javascript...
let phonebook =  [
  {id: 0, name: "Sam", pNumber: "478-123-1234"},
  {id: 1, name: "Jake", pNumber: "404-567-7890"},
  {id: 2, name: "Evan" , pNumber: "707-897-4567"}
];

function findEntry(array, key, value) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (array[i][key] === value) {
      return array[i];
    }
  }
  return null;
}

let query = findEntry(phonebook, 'id', 1);

console.log(query);
